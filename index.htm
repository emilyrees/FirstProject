  <p> I have finally learned how to <mark>code!</mark> I really enjoy doing this kind of stuff because I can finally make websitess for my dad or anyone else that I know who might need them!</p>
<p> One of the things I really enjoy is computer science. I dont like how <strong>frustrating</strong> it can be, but that is also what makes it fun</p>
