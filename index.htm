<h2> Here is a little bit about me! </h2>
  <hr>
<p> I have finally learned how to code! I really enjoy doing this kind of stuff because I can finally make websitess for my dad or anyone else that I know who might need them!</p>
<p> One of the things I really enjoy is computer science. I dont like how frustrating it can be, but that is also what makes it fun</p>
