  <p style=" color:white;"> I have finally learned how to <mark>code!</mark> I really enjoy doing this kind of stuff because I can finally make websitess for my dad or anyone else that I know who might need them!</p>

<p style=" color:white;"> One of the things I really enjoy is computer science. I dont like how <strong>frustrating</strong> it can be, but that is also what makes it fun</p>

<h3 style="color:white;text-align:left;"> There these four things that are called the core 4. 
  The core4 are: Functions, loops, variables, and conditionals. The technical definitions of them are:
  
  <br><button onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='pic_bulbon.gif'">
    Function: Something that you can make and add to a code to condense the code into something smaller. </button></br>
  <img id="myImage" src="snippet of function.jpg" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
    
  <br>Variable: It is something that you can asign a certain amount to. </br>

  <br>Loops: You can use these to repeat a line of code so the code isnt super long. </br>

  <br>Conditionals: A conditional is something that you use to put into a line of code to make it happen at a certain time. 
"If _______, then _______." </br>
