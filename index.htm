  <p style=" color:white;"> I have finally learned how to <mark>code!</mark> I really enjoy doing this kind of stuff because I can finally make websitess for my dad or anyone else that I know who might need them!</p>

<h3 style="color:white;"> There these four things that are called the core 4. 
  The core4 are: Functions, loops, variables, and conditionals. The technical definitions of them are
  
  <br>Function: Something that you can make and add to a code to condense the code into something smaller. </br>

    <br>Variable: It is something that you can asign a certain amount to. </br>
  
  <br>Loops: You can use these to repeat a line of code so the code isnt super long. </br>

<br>Conditionals: A conditional is something that you use to put into a line of code to make it happen at a certain time. 
"If _______, then _______." </br></h3>
